I use machine learning to predict the presence of dementia in patients based on their MRI data. 
This data was obtained from the Kaggle MRI and Alzheimer's dataset but originated from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. 
The specific dataset used is Cross-sectional MRI data in Young, Middle Aged, Nondemented and Demented Older Adults.

The data can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jboysen/mri-and-alzheimers/data
